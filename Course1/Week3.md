# Need and System Specification

To effectively translate needs into actionable system requirements and detailed specifications, we must understand the hierarchy and iterative nature of the process, as well as the theories that guide information use and decision-making.

### Hierarchy of Needs, Requirements, and Specifications

1. **Needs**:
    - **Definition**: Needs are the high-level objectives or goals that users have. These are often broad and user-focused.
    - **Example**: Providers need to see a patientâ€™s diagnosis when ordering medications.
2. **Requirements**:
    - **Definition**: Requirements translate needs into specific functionalities or conditions that the system must fulfill.
    - **Example**: The system should display the patient's problem list during the medication ordering process.
3. **Specifications**:
    - **Definition**: Specifications detail the technical aspects of how requirements will be implemented in the system.
    - **Example**: A specific screen in the electronic health record (EHR) system shall display the problem list in a designated field, with specific dimensions and color codes for visibility.

### Process of Elicitation and Specification

- **Iterative Nature**: Eliciting needs and translating them into requirements and specifications is iterative. Continuous feedback and adjustments are essential to ensure alignment with user expectations and practical feasibility.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Decision-makers, including domain experts and technologists, must collaborate to balance user needs with technical constraints and trade-offs.
- **Methods**:
    - **Interviews**: Direct conversations with users to understand their needs.
    - **Role-Playing**: Simulating scenarios to uncover implicit requirements.
    - **Prototyping**: Creating mock-ups or functional prototypes to visualize and refine requirements.

### Addressing Scope Creep

- **Scope Creep**: The gradual expansion of project scope due to additional features or requirements being added.
- **Mitigation**: Clearly define and document requirements early in the project. Use phrases like "shall," "should," and "could" to prioritize features and set clear boundaries. Consult with stakeholders to assess the impact of new requests on budget and timelines.

### Theories of Information Use and Decision-Making

1. **Don't Make Me Think**:
    - **Principle**: Systems should be intuitive and easy to use, minimizing the need for user effort to understand functionality.
    - **Example**: A simple, clear search engine interface.
2. **Berry Picking**:
    - **Principle**: Users gather information iteratively and non-linearly, like picking berries from different bushes.
    - **Example**: PubMed's citation saving feature for ongoing research.
3. **Sense Making**:
    - **Principle**: Users create mental models and narratives to understand information.
    - **Example**: Online health communities where users share stories and experiences.
4. **Cognitive Work Analysis**:
    - **Principle**: Focus on understanding how users perform their work to design supportive systems.
    - **Example**: Interviews or use case scenarios to elicit detailed work processes.

### Theories of Decision-Making

1. **Dual Process Theory**:
    - **Principle**: Decision-making involves both fast, intuitive (System 1) and slow, analytical (System 2) processes.
    - **Example**: A risk calculator that quickly highlights high-risk areas while relying on complex calculations in the background.
2. **Transtheoretical Model**:
    - **Principle**: Behavioral change occurs in stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.
    - **Example**: CDC's education page on Ebola, addressing different stages of user awareness and action.
3. **Social Cognitive Theory**:
    - **Principle**: Focuses on self-efficacy and the belief in one's ability to take action.
    - **Example**: Patient decision aids designed to boost confidence and provide clear action plans.

### Practical Application

Theories provide frameworks to ensure that all aspects of user needs and behavior are considered in system design. They serve as checklists to avoid missing critical elements and help balance theoretical considerations with practical constraints.

By combining these approaches, we can create systems that effectively meet user needs, are technically feasible, and support efficient and informed decision-making.
